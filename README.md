## Professional Website Development Portfolio Site

After leaving agency work and moving to freelance I need a new site to advertise and market, as well as help build my brand.

I built this project to do just that. This will help with my marketing and advertising efforts, give me a place to show off my best work, and get my brand out there.

I'm going to use AWS to stand up this new portfolio site.

I'm also going to try and make the new site contain all of the following:

Basic HTML elements and style:

a) Doctype

b) Header Information

c) Metadata

d) Styles

e) Orderered or Unordered lists

f) Hypertext links

h) Images

Create a CSS set of formatting standards

Utilize a page layout including:

a) Header with navigation bar

b) Body content with two columns

c) Collapsible footer

Graphical elements:

a) Use of enhancements such as shadows/gradients

Including a table or column

Including a web form with the following:

a) Text area

b) Labels/Input box

c) Drop-down list

d) Selection list

e) Radio button

f) Submit/Reset button

Incorporating a multimedia element

Including a current date/time element using JavaScript
