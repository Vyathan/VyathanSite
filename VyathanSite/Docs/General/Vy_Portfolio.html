            <h3><a href="https://natureschain.com">Nature's Chain of Lakes Campground</a></h3>
            <P><strong>Nature's Chain of Lakes Campground</strong> came to me with a site that was created using Frontpage back in the early 2000's, to say it needed an update is an understatement. The site was barely functional. Ultimately it was decided that there was nothing salvageable from the old site and we started a complete new build. The new site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on AWS. Because of this, the site is clean, modern, and fast. Using AWS means that the new site is hosted on the most reliable servers in the world. The end result is a user friendly website that matches their current branding.</P>
